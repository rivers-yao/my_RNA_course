# First Impression

Type values and mathematical formulas into R’s command prompt
```{r rmarkdown}
1 + 1
```

Assign values to symbols (variables)
```{r}
x = 1
x + x
```

Invoke functions such as c(), which takes any number of values and returns a single vector
```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3)
x
```

R functions, such as sqrt(), often operate efficienty on vectors
```{r}
y = sqrt(x)
y
```


# R Data types: vector and list

‘Atomic’ vectors

* Types include integer, numeric (float-point; real), complex, logical, character, raw (bytes)

```{r}
people <- c("Lori", "Yubo", "Greg", "Nitesh", "Valerie", "Herve")
people
```

* Atomic vectors can be named
```{r}
population <- c(Buffalo=259000, Rochester=210000, `New York`=8400000)
population
log10(population)
```

* Statistical concepts like NA (“not available”)
```{r}
truthiness <- c(TRUE, FALSE, NA)
truthiness
```

* Logical concepts like ‘and’ (&), ‘or’ (|), and ‘not’ (!)
```{r}
!truthiness
truthiness | !truthiness
truthiness & !truthiness
```

* Numerical concepts like infinity (Inf) or not-a-number (NaN, e.g., 0 / 0)
```{r}
undefined_numeric_values <- c(NA, 0/0, NaN, Inf, -Inf)
undefined_numeric_values
sqrt(undefined_numeric_values)
```

* Common string manipulations
```{r}
toupper(people)
substr(people, 1, 3)

```

* R is a green consumer – recylcing short vectors to align with long vectors
```{r}
x <- 1:3
x * 2
truthiness | NA
truthiness & NA
```

* It’s very common to nest operations, which can be simultaneously compact, confusing, and expressive (`[`: subset; `<`: less than)
```{r}
substr(tolower(people), 1, 3)
population[population < 1000000]
```

# Class data.frame and beyond

Variables are often related to one another in a highly structured way, e.g., two ‘columns’ of data in a spreadsheet
```{r}
x = rnorm(1000)       # 1000 random normal deviates
y = x + rnorm(1000)   # another 1000 deviates, as a function of x
head(x)
head(y)
plot(y ~ x)           # relationship bewteen x and y
```

Convenient to manipulate them together

* `data.frame()` :like columns in a spreadsheet
```{r}
df = data.frame(X=x, Y=y)
head(df)           # first 6 rows
plot(Y ~ X, df)    # same as above
```

* See all data with `View(df)`. Summarize data with `summary(df)`
```{r}
summary(df)
```

* Easy to manipulate data in a coordinated way, e.g., access column X with $ and subset for just those values greater than 0
```{r}
positiveX = df[df$X > 0,]
head(positiveX)
plot(Y ~ X, positiveX)
```

* R is introspective – ask it about itself
```{r}
class(df)
dim(df)
colnames(df)
```

A scatterplot makes one want to fit a linear model (do a regression analysis)

* Use a *formula* to describe the relationship between variables
* Variables found in the second argument
```{r }
fit <- lm(Y ~ X, df)
``` 
* Visualize the points, and add the regression line
```{r}
plot(Y ~ X, df)
abline(fit, col="red", lwd=3)
```           



# Help!
Help available in Rstudio or interactively

* Check out the help page for rnorm()
```{r}
?rnorm
```

* Usage’ section describes how the function can be used

* Arguments, some with default values. Arguments matched first by name, then position

* Arguments’ section describes what the arguments are supposed to be

* ‘Value’ section describes return value

* ‘Examples’ section illustrates use

* Often include citations to relevant technical documentation, reference to related functions, obscure details

* Can be intimidating, but in the end actually very useful

# Session info

Here is the output of `sessionInfo()` on the system on which this
document was compiled:

```{r sessionInfo, echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
